	    	<p>Community experiences lead to a more engaged student and a more engaged student is more likely to persist.</p>
	    	<p>In the Courtyard, community building and peer-mentoring is promoted through social connections between Students, Faculty, and Staff. The Courtyard engages students in conversations around topics, without the awkwardness associated with personal connections (“friending”, “following”). With all the features of a robust chat engine, students can engage in topical discussions – in private, in small group conversations, or on a campus- or school-wide basis. Staff &amp; faculty are present as well, enabling the student to have ready-access to human resources at the school. Unlike public social media, our Courtyard includes every student at the school but not the general public. Using Connected Campus as the front-door interface to the school, students will be notified of activity and will choose their personal level of participation.</p>
